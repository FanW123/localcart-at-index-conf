### Using the shared producer to generate clickstream events

To simplify the workshop environment a Shopping app event producer has been deployed in the workshop environment you are using. 
This producer simulates shopping events (such as users logging in, browsing items, adding items to the cart, etc) and sends them to a pre-provisioned Message Hub service instance that you have access to.

To capture these events use the Message Hub connectivy information that was provided to you.
